MySQLCSVParser

A simple Java parser database tool.

Removes special characters and extra commas from badly-converted CSV (comma-separated value) data, usually from an old Excel file.

After running through this subroutine, the characters are removed and commas in their right places to be converted to trusted CSV format and uploaded to MySQL or other database.

No license, feel free to use and share.
